# Cobalt2 Syntax _(No Highlights)_

Cobalt2 - the Sublime Text theme, ported to Atom!

An Atom syntax theme based on our old blue friend cobalt. A refined colour scheme that is easy on the eyes.

Pairs well with built-in One Dark UI Theme.

## What's Different

This is just a fork from Wes Bos' popular theme. The differences are: 

* Variables and certain keywords no longer have a slightly different background color.
* Javascript object keys (non-quoted) are now mint colored (à la his latest [commit](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2/commit/157292725a6717807fd3372bdc7a7e00bb213be6) to the sublime theme)
